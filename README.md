This JavaScript utility generates a text-based pyramid of a specified height. The pyramid is centered, using a specified character for the pyramid blocks. This simple yet flexible script can be used in various applications where visual representation is needed.

This is a practice project from freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course.
